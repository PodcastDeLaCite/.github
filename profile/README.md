The Podcast de La Cité formerly was a student organization at the [Gymnase de La Cité](https://www.gymnasecite.ch/), in Switzerland.

The students that managed this podcast eventually graduated, and no one took their place, hence nobody maintains it actively now.

The old podcasts are still hosted and can be listened to on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/podcastdecite), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5CyurTV5NtkcCCfSFgeO7S), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/fr/podcast/podcast-du-gymnase-de-la-cit%C3%A9/id1518878420), or [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8yNWMxMTViOC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==), tho **they're only avalaible in French**.
